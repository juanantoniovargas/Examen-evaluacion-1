Introduction
------------

Quantum computing is a modern way of computing that is based on the science of quantum mechanics 
and its unbelievable phenomena. 

It is a beautiful combination of physics, mathematics, computer 
science and information theory. 

It provides high computational power, less energy consumption and exponential 
speed over classical computers by controlling the behavior of small physical objects 
i.e. microscopic particles like atoms, electrons, photons, etc. Here, we present an introduction 
to the fundamental concepts and some ideas of quantum computing.

Prototypes
-----------

Quantum computing is heating up, as a growing number of entities race to benchmark, stabilize, and ultimately commercialize this technology.

Here you are some of the most outstanding prototypes:

IBM's					Google's					USTC's
Quiskit					Sycamore					Zuchongzhi
